- Observational learning (OL) and word-of-mouth learning (WOML), two main types of social learning, can influence online consumer decisions.

- Online consumers tend to collect information to assist consumption decisions (Huang & Benyoucef, 2013) by adopting social learning (SL) methods (Bandura, 1977; Cheung, Liu, & Lee, 2015). One traditional SL method is observational learning (OL) (Bandura & McClelland, 1977; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, & Welch, 1998).

- Online platforms have developed some advanced IT tools to facilitate consumers’ OL and WOM by providing historical sales and online reviews.

- It is still unclear whether OL or WOML is more effective in assisting consumers’ decisions. Although several studies have measured their effects (Gilal,  Zhang, Gilal, & Gilal, 2019;    Godes & Mayzlin, 2004;    Hanson & Putler, 1996;    Herhausen, Ludwig, Grewal, Wulf, & Schoegel, 2019;    Xinxin Li, Hitt, & Zhang, 2011;    Liu, 2006;    Nakayama & Wan, 2021;    Salganik, Dodds, & Watts, 2006;    Soltysinski & Dholakia, 2001;    J. Zhang, 2010;    Zhuang, Cui, & Peng, 2018),   only a few studies have argued their differences on consumers’ purchase decisions (Y. Chen, Wang, & Xie, 2011;    Cheung, Xiao, & Liu, 2014;    Xitong Li & Wu, 2013

- .    In addition, prior studies have tended to treat consumers’ payment intentions or consumption decisions as the ultimate outcomes of their model (X.  Shi, Zheng, & Yang, 2020), particularly when exploring how social learning affects consumers’ final purchase decisions (Y.  Chen et al., 2011;    Cheung et al., 2014; Xitong Li & Wu, 2013).

- few studies have considered the differences between the effects of OL and WOML on the consumer decision process and their influential mechanisms.

- consumers observe others’ purchase choices, also known as OL,

- Bandura (1977) argued that observing others’ choices and obtaining information influences individuals’ behaviors. OL affects consumers’ purchase decisions. Informational cascades (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, & Welch, 1992)    explain the mechanism of OL, and it can be of interest to highlight this phenomenon in online shopping. The weight of the observed purchase behavior of all previous buyers is far greater than that of consumers’ knowledge when they are making purchase decisions because of the scarcity of available information (Bikhchandani et al., 1992).   Numerous studies have repeatedly proven that OL influences the result of consumer purchase decisions. Some have tested the influence via laboratory studies (Anderson, Goeree, & Holt, 2002;    Çelen & Kariv, 2004),    whereas others have illustrated the effects through field tests (Cai,  Chen, & Fang, 2009;    Y. Chen et al., 2011;    J. Zhan
