- [[Abstract]]
	- We present DRIVE (Dynamic Routing of Independent VEhicles), a planning module to be incorporated in a decision support system for the direct transportation at Van Gend and Loos BV. Van Gend and Loos BV is the largest company providing road transportation in the Benelux, with about 1400 vehicles transporting 160,000 packages from thousands of senders to tens of thousands of addressees per day. The heart of DRIVE is a branch-and-price algorithm. Approximation and incomplete optimization techniques as well as a sophisticated column management scheme have been employed to create the right balance between solution speed and solution quality. DRIVE has been tested by simulating a dynamic planning environment with real-life data and has produced very encouraging results.
