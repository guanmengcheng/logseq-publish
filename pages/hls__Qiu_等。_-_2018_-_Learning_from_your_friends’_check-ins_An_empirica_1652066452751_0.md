- Observational learning is an informational expla-nation of the correlated behavior among friends: Anindividual’s decision is affected by the observation offriends’ choices because of their informational con-tent (Cai et al. 2009).

- The effect of observational learn-ing is complicated by several plausible confoundingmechanisms. The first is the normative conformityeffect (normative social influence). People may want tobehave like their friends because they want to conform(e.g., peer pressure).

- The sec-ond mechanism is the homophily-driven diffusion pro-cess described by Aral et al. (2009): Inherent similari-ties in friends’ personal (time-invariant) characteristicscan also cause correlated friends’ choices.

- Prior workhas focused on the moderating role of social ties onthe effectiveness of word of mouth or observationallearning: Strong ties are more influential than weakties (Bakshy et al. 2012, Shi and Whinston 2013, Araland Walker 2014, Liu et al. 2014).

- What is not well understood is how the magni-tude of observational learning is moderated by socialties as well as geographic locations.
