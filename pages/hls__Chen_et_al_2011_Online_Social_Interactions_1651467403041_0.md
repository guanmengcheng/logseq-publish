- The marketing literature (e.g., Arndt1967) defines the former type of opinion- or preference-basedsocial interaction as word of mouth (WOM). The psychologyand economics literature (Bandura 1977; Bikhchandani,Hirshleifer, and Welch 1998, 2008) defines the latter type ofaction- or behavior-based social interaction as observationallearning (OL).

- Not only are consumers nowbetter able to exchange information through online forums,chat rooms, and blogs, but firms are gaining increasingcapacity to initiate and manage consumer social interactionsdirectly (Godes et al. 2005)

- We study social interactions following the definition andframework Godes et al. (2005) propose and focus on twocommon types: WOM and OL.

- In contrast, the second form of social interaction weexamine here, OL, is less explored in the marketing litera-ture. The concept of OL can be traced back to social learn-ing studies in psychology (Bandura 1977). How OL influ-ences an individual purchase decision is largely centered onthe information cascade theory in the economics literature(Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch 1992). According tothis theory, OL information contains the discrete signalsexpressed by the actions of other consumers but not the rea-sons behind their actions. With limited information available,when people observe the purchase actions of all previousconsumers, this publicly observed information outweighstheir own private information in shaping their beliefs. Even-tually, an information cascade can occur, such that all sub-sequent observers will hold similar beliefs. As a result, peo-ple follow their predecessors’ actions and become engagedin a type of herd behavior (Banerjee 1992).

- Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) illustratethe basic concept of OL using a model of consumer productadoption decision making, in which a consumer adopts(rejects) a product if he or she believes that the quality ofthe product is high (low). For simplicity, consider a casewith three consumers. This model shows that the third con-sumer will adopt (reject) the product if he or she observesthat both previous consumers adopt (reject) the product,regardless of his or her private information. The consumerwill rely on his or her own information only when one con-sumer adopts and another rejects. Whether a person will fol-low previous choices largely depends on the percentageshare of previous choices (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, andWelch 1998, p. 156). This simple case helps illustrate theconcept of OL valence.

- Observational learning differs from WOM in two importantaspects: the amount and the credibility of the information.Compared with WOM, OL contains less information. UnlikeWOM information, which often contains both opinions/ recommendations of other consumers and the reasons forthem, OL information reveals only the actions of other con-sumers but not the reasons behind them (Bikhchandani, Hir-shleifer, and Welch 1998). However, because actions speaklouder than words, the action-based OL information mightbe perceived as more credible than WOM.
