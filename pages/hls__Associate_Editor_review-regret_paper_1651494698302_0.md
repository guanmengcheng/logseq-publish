- popularity (accumulated sales) seems to be a more diagnostic cue of product performance compared with the co-participant’s response time. Why does the consumer rely on the latter to make purchase decisions?

- higher popularity may induce more external attributions of the partner’s late response (i.e., attributions unrelated to product performance), leading to a decrease of the focal effect.

- I didn’t see how the authors controlled for endogenous variables such as product quality. In addition, when the campaign was initiated (e.g., day vs. night, or work days vs. weekends) may also influence consumer regret and should be controlled.

- A non-linear effect here sounds reasonable for me and is worth exploration.

- I suggest the authors to give an official definition of such a new business model (i.e., two-person group buying), which can help justify the contribution related to context.

- So, I am confused about what new idea is introduced by focusing on the two-person group-buying.

- The hypotheses development part is weak and needs more evidence to support the theoretical framework. There are several unsupported claims in the hypothesis development section. For example, the authors do not give any reference when developing hypothesis 1.

- The authors do not control variables related to product quality, such as product rating, product price, etc.

- However, their model does not control the disconfirmation between pre-use expectation and post-use experiences, which is the core of EDT proposed by Oliver (1980).

- However, the main effect of DealPop is missed in Model 2. Similarly, the authors should control the main effect of Discount instead of DealPop.
