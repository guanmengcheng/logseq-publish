- Owing to the growing popularity of social media, online business models have shifted from traditional e-commerce that focuses on one-click buying and one-way browsing to social commerce that enables consumers to digitize their purchase decision journey by establishing two-way communications and sound collaborative relationships with other consumers

- The importance of social interaction is widely recognized in e-commerce environments (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, & Gremler, 2004; Liu, 2006; Park & Kim, 2008; Yap, Soetarto, & Sweeney, 2013; Lu, Li, Zhang, & Rai, 2014);

- consumers are eager to obtain more relevant product information and professional suggestions (e.g., ratings, comments, and recommendations) from others’ expertise and experience since products have become increasingly complex and technical in nature (Godes et al., 2005).

- To bridge these gaps, this study sets out to answer the following research question: Do social interactions in the social commerce environment affect consumers’ intention to purchase, which in turn leads to actual purchase and post-purchase behaviors?

- Drawing on WOM theory (Arndt, 1967) and observational learning theory (Bandura, 1977; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, & Welch, 1998, Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, & Welch, 2008), we conceptualize social interactions in social commerce environments into two forms: WOM communication and observing other consumers’ purchases.

- Another form of social interaction, the tendency to observe others consumers’ purchase behaviors and decisions can be explained by observational learning theory (Bikhchandani et al., 1998, 2008; Chen et al., 2011)

- Observational learning refers to learning through observing the behavior of other people, which could affect the individual’s behavior in many ways, with both positive and negative consequences

- This theory highlights that people gather information from others when they are faced with new tasks that allows them to virtually eliminate the need for complex mental processing effort on making a decision

- People weight on others’ information more heavily than their own information when observational learning occurs(Banerjee,1992).

- Simpson, Siguaw, and Cadogan (2008) have explained that the opinions of others’ purchases can be regarded as the information to take into consideration in the purchase decisionmaking process, because such information as a heuristics enables consumers to simplify decision making and overcome information overload.

- Research on e-commerce has revealed that the information obtained from observing previous consumers’ purchases is associated with purchase actions (buy or not buy)

- We would therefore argue that WOM communication and observing other consumers’ purchases are essential elements of social interaction in social commerce for capturing the properties of social interactions among consumers, and their effects will thus influence consumers’ decision making processes.

- conclusion
-
- This study investigated purchase intentions and actual purchase behaviors in a social commerce environment from the perspectives of WOM and observational learning to examine social interactions. Both types of social interaction activities embedded on social commerce sites influence the intention to purchase and hence the actual purchase and post-purchase behaviors. More specifically, our results revealed that positive valence WOM and WOM content significantly affect consumers’ intention to buy a product in a social commerce community. At the same time, our study found that intention to purchase driven by social interaction in socia commerce can increase the likelihood of actual buying and sharing product information with peers. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical model to explain how a consumer decides to purchase a product on a social commerce site through interacting with the platforms themselves, the sellers, and other buyers.
