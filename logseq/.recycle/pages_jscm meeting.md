Hi I can't unmute and show my video.
SOM-LXY对所有人说 (上午8:03)
NOTE: Participant who has questions can type in your question in the chat.
Tingting Yan对所有人说 (上午8:05)
For someone whose native language is not English, would you say qualitative research is more challenging and risky, compared to quantitative research (particularly for early career researchers)? Any recommendations for overcoming language barriers?
Wendy Tate对所有人说 (上午8:12)
I think many qualitative papers are not transparent in the methodology.  What tips/tricks do you have to overcome this?
Cheng Chi对所有人说 (上午8:14)
for the empirical study, if your regress results are significant, how to improve it or how to show it?
sorry, are not
Wendy Tate对所有人说 (上午8:24)
What an amazing panel.  Thanks for all of the great insights and for your participation in the symposium!
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午8:24)
I think Zhaohui is making a great point in terms of showing the True process from raw data to theory, not just what codes and constructs and relationships are kept in the end, but also what constructs or relationships are dropped or changed during the process, to make the arguments and results feel more REAL, and trustworthy.
Rico Merkert对所有人说 (上午8:47)
would it be possible to get a copy of these slides, please?
SOM-HOST对所有人说 (上午8:52)
We will consult the facilitators of this symposium and answer your question.

Thanks for your wonderful sharing!  What if the construct in my paper didn’t used in the previous researches? Could you please give me any advice on how I can name it?
Wendy Tate/JSCM对所有人说 (上午9:35)
Please post your questions!
SOM-LBB对所有人说 (上午9:41)
What do editors care about most when reviewing the manuscripts? Thank you.
Iana Shaheen对所有人说 (上午9:41)
Hello everyone, I have a question. How important is the cover letter and what are some good things/tips to include in it outside traditional information? Thank you!
Medo对所有人说 (上午9:44)
what is JBL's review time?
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午9:44)
For an interdisciplinary research, what would be some recommendations to ensure a fit between the manuscript and the mission/scope of the journal?
Medo对所有人说 (上午9:45)
also question to everyone, is diversity and inclusion criteria considered while recruiting for editorial boards of your journals? and can you explain how please? thanks
Diane Mollenkopf对所有人说 (上午9:45)
JBL asks reviewers to submit their reports within 30 days. Choosing reviewers and then having the SE contribute takes the entire process to about 60 days
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午9:49)
@Medo: for JSCM, we value diversity and inclusion in authorships, reviewer board, readership. For instance, geographically, symposiums that are held in different regions (like this one) is an example of how we try to bring top journals to different regions to motivate authors to submit papers and recruit reviewers. We also have regional editors that could help us reach out to researchers in different parts of the world.
Medo对所有人说 (上午9:50)
Amazing, thank you Tingting!
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午9:50)
Review time in IJOPM: less than 30 days without desk rejects includes. With desk reject included which is very biased: 8 days. However, we are slower in the pandemic than before.
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午9:53)
Diversity: particularly, we care about research from different regions, which means that we also do go to many universities in different regions (currently Thailand). We also take it very much into account when appointing AEs. If you want to have Editors join faculty meetings, doctoral schools, reach out. You see that most journals are interested in helping out underrepresented regions/ groups etc.
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午9:56)
@interdisciplinary research: let me answer provocatively. I think the OM/ SCM community is by its nature diverse, nevertheless truly interdisciplinary research might have an easier life in other disciplines. Although we are getting better: For example, this is an interdisciplinary team and special issue in IJOPM Call for papers: “Rethinking Resilience in Today’s Complex, Interconnected World: Linking Supply Chain Resilience Research with Other Disciplines”
Journal: International Journal of Operations and Production Management
Guest Editors: Andreas Wieland, Mark Stevenson, Steven A Melnyk, Simin Davoudi, Lisen Schultz
SOM-LBB对所有人说 (上午9:58)
I have another question. We seldom introduce the research background in the abstract, but some papers are based on the changed time background, which makes the old reseach problem generate new research values. So when writing the abstract, how to make choices in the description of the research background if your want to catch the readers? Thank you.
Diane Mollenkopf对所有人说 (上午9:59)
We are all encouraged to engage in interdisciplinary research these days, but we still have to make sure the manuscript "fits" the journal to which we are submitting. So we need to think about the story we are telling with our research for the given journal.
SOM-LXY对所有人说 (上午10:02)
Here is my question. How to balance the practicability and theoretical contribution? If a manuscript is fair in theoretical contributions but its application can create great value, what can we do to improve its theoretical part? Thank you.
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午10:03)
@SOM-LBB: Highlighting what has changed over time to justify the importance of your research question in the abstract is a great question. However, you want to avoid making the abstract too long, while at the same time try to use accurate wording so you do not create misconceptions about your research early on. Remember, the abstract and title give Editors the first impression about your paper. It is better to prioritize rigor/accuracy over fancy statement that is not accurate.
SOM-LBB对所有人说 (上午10:05)
That's very helpful to me. Thank you so much, professor Yan.
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午10:06)
@SOM-LXY: Regarding how to find theoretical angle to explain practically important findings, I think, if the findings are really ground breaking from a practice perspective, you could always find a way to show its theoretical value, i.e. identifying a new construct, finding an non-intuitive relationship, challenging a widely-held assumption, etc. Remember: the best theory has to be a practical theory. You just need to find the right angle.
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午10:06)
Abstract: we have a structured in IJOPM. Originality, methodology. This forces you to make the most important point. Accuracy and precision are most important!
318对所有人说 (上午10:07)
How does IJOPM accept the paper using questionnaire
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午10:07)
@Tingting: My biased view, most of the interesting research questions can be found in practice, not with the search for research gaps. Plus you’re ahead of the curve of the researchers that search for research gaps in the literature. So get out of the research offices and go to industry.
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午10:08)
Thank you, Diane and Constantin, for your answers about interdisciplinary research, I can not agree more.
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午10:10)
@Constantin, I totally agree! Going out to industry is a great way of identifying meaningful (and sometimes much more efficient) ways of developing interesting theories!
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午10:10)
@Surveys: There are a couple journals out there that disencouraged surveys, but there are many journals that still like them including Academy of Management Journal. In OM, it seems that some journals like now experiments, but I always like to highlight that in the 70ies Marketing journals only accepted experiments, but stop doing this followed by a survey period. So it’s a question of time when surveys also come back in the other journals. Most important in survey research is: theoretical backing and contribution. Make sure that you don’t reinvent the methodology by introducing your own way of doing OLS (e.g.). And respect the most recent rigour standards for survey research.
SOM-LXY对所有人说 (上午10:12)
Thank you for your answer, Professor Yan. That makes sense.
Sean Asian对所有人说 (上午10:14)
With drastic changes happening in business world, several theories and underlying assumptions in our field are being challenged and becoming simply irrelevant. How Editors adopt such changes and communicate and guide potential authors to see more relevant research works. Thanks all.
Constantin Blome (IJOPM)对所有人说 (上午10:15)
Dear Sean, great to meet you. I would say what a great opportunity. I always say, most of the Covid research is descriptive, but if you present a paper that TCE no longer provides an important contribution in case of crisis (e.g. covid, Ukraine) will be a very valuable and probably most cited papers for the next 10 years.
Diane Mollenkopf对所有人说 (上午10:15)
@Sean Asian - this is a good point. As editors we need to be open to new directions in research and theoretical approaches in the current world situation.
Tingting Yan | JSCM对所有人说 (上午10:15)
@Sean Asian, At JSCM, we are running emerging discourse incubator, which tries to encourage researchers to work on timely topics.
